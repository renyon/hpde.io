        "Description": "Australia has made major contributions to research in solar physics for several decades. Solar images are a major kind of records of solar activities. The SWS has monitored and archived solar activity images from Culgoora and Learmonth for more than two decades. They include H-Alpha (2003-2014) and White Light(2004-2013) images from Culgoora, and H-Alpha(2004-2009), GONG H-Alpha (since 2013), GONG White Light(since 2010)and GONG Magnetogram(since 2010) images from Learmonth. A new single mounted three telescopes has installed at Culgoora. Culgoora solar image data is available since 02/01/2003.",
        "Acknowledgement": "We are thankful to the Culgoora Solar Observatory of Space Weather Network, Bureau of Meteorology of Australia for the observations of Culgoora Solar Image data.",
