        "Description": "\n     The Low Frequency Atmospheric Weather Electromagnetic\n     System for Observation, Modeling, and Education, or LF AWESOME is a\n     high-sensitivity radio receiver for the frequency band 0.5-470 kHz.\n     The receiver is an upgraded version of the VLF AWESOME, which\n     provided high sensitivity broadband radio\n     measurements of natural lightning emissions, transmitting beacons,\n     and radio emissions from the near-Earth space environment. The\n     expanded capabilities of LF AWESOME allow detection of radio\n     atmospherics from lightning strokes at \n     global distances and multiple traverses a round the world. It also\n     allows monitoring of transmitting beacons in the LF/MF band at\n     thousands of km distance.\n \n   Most of the data is collected on two air-core loop\n   antennas, oriented orthogonal, to collect the two horizontal\n   components of the magnetic field. The north-south, or N/S antenna\n   is sensitive mostly to waves arriving from the north of from the\n   south direction, meaning it picks up the magnetic field component\n   in the east-west direction. The other antenna is the east-west\n   antenna, which is the opposite. \n\n   Broadband data contain direct samples of the receiver output, usually\n   at 100 kHz or 1 MHz sampling frequency. These files essentially\n   contain everything that the receiver records, entirely\n   uncompressed. The files are very large, for instance just one\n   minute of VLF data will produce a ~12 MB file for each antenna\n   channel. This adds up to 35 GB per day if you have two antenna\n   channels.",
