Once the gif image is displayed, \nthere are arrow keys that allow the user to move forward and backward in time.  The user can download the gif by right click / save \npicture as or click on Download the pdf version to see and download the higher quality pdf plot.  There is a TIDE Website navigation \nbar at the bottom of the webpage.  The user can zoom in on an area of interest by clicking on the image at that point.  That takes the \nuser to the High Time Resolution Spectrogram Custom Plot Webpage, where after changing any default processing options and \nSubmitting Request, a new spectrogram plot will be created.\n\t\t\t\t"
