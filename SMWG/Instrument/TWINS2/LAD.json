        "Description": "TWINS2, Lyman-alpha Detector, LAD, The TWINS Lyman-alpha detector consists of two independent sensors to measure Lyman-alpha radiation being emitted by neutral hydrogen atoms. The sensors are oriented at angles of ±40° with respect to the actuator spin axis. Each sensor has a full width, half maximum, FWHM, field of view of 4°, defined by collimation hole baffles, uses Lyman-a interference filters as narrow band transmissions filters, and applies a KBr or CsI photodiode for photon detection. The Lyman-alpha detector is located on the rotating actuator platform in order to provide a full 360° azimuthal angle coverage. It has a time resolution of 60 s.",
