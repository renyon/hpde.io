        "Description": "NASA's IBEX (Interstellar Boundary Explorer) spacecraft\nwas launched 19-Oct-2008 to discover the interaction between the solar wind\nand the interstellar medium.  Its two energetic neutral atom (ENA)\ninstruments measure 10 eV - 6 keV ENA's indicative of charged particle\npopulations near and beyond the heliosphere's termination shock.  The\nspacecraft is in a geocentric, 8-day orbit between 7000 km and 37 Re. \nIts spin axis is adjusted each orbit to point towards the sun.  Its two ENA\ndetectors look normal to the spin axis, thus measuring 360 deg swaths of\nthe sky each 15-sec spacecraft spin.  The full sky is measured every\n6 months.",
