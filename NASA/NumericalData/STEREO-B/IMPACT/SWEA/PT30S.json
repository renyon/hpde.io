      "Caveats": "Since commissioning, the SWEA instruments on both STEREO spacecraft have registered difficult to characterize degradations in the solar wind core electron energies, probably due to charging effects. The nature of the degradations are such that we cannot reliably report electron measurements below 45 eV. However, halo and higher energy electrons are unaffected. Versions 4 and higher of the SWEA 3D distribution data products have these lower energies removed. Similarly, versions 4 and higher of the SWEA pitch angle distribution products also remove these energies. Use of the SWEA pitch angle distributions for most purposes (for example, higher energy heat flux PADs) should be largely unaffected. For more information regarding these issues please contact Peter Schroeder (peters@ssl.berkeley.edu). IF YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED VERSION 3 or earlier FILES, THOSE FILES CONTAIN UNRELIABLE DATA BELOW 45 EV AND SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH VERSION 4. Note that if the interpretation of these data become a significant focus in your work, you should obtain explicit prior permission from the PI of the experiment before publication."
